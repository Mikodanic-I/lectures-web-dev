            Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
            Molly is the singer in a band
            Desmond says to Molly, girl, I like your face
            And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
            Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store
            Buys a twenty carat golden ring
            Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
            And as he gives it to her she begins to sing
            Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            In a couple of years they have built
            A home sweet home
            With a couple of kids running in the yard
            Of Desmond and Molly Jones
            Happy ever after in the market place
            Desmond lets the children lend a hand
            Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
            And in the evening she still sings it with the band
            Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            In a couple of years they have built
            A home sweet home
            With a couple of kids running in the yard
            Of Desmond and Molly Jones
            Happy ever after in the market place
            Molly lets the children lend a hand
            Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
            And in the evening she's a singer with the band
            Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
            La-la, how the life goes on
            And if you want some fun, sing ob-la-di, bla-da
